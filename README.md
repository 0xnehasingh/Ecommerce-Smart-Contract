## Overview
The Ecommerce Smart Contract is a Solidity-based solution for facilitating secure and transparent online transactions within an e-commerce ecosystem.

## Features
- **Product Registration**: Sellers can register their products with a title, description, and price.
- **Secure Transactions**: Buyers can purchase products by paying the exact price in Ether.
- **Delivery Confirmation**: Buyers can confirm delivery of the product, triggering the transfer of funds to the seller.
- **Event Emission**: Events are emitted for product registration, purchase, and delivery confirmation.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-smart-contract.git

2. Install the required dependencies (if any).
3. Deploy the smart contract to an Ethereum network using a Solidity compiler compatible with version 0.8.9.
4. Interact with the deployed smart contract through function calls from a user interface or other smart contracts.
